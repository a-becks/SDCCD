This project takes dates for hotel reservations and displays the total charge for the stay.  The user inputs an arrival date and a departure date, which must be after the arrival date.  The length of the stay is calculated and the total price is displayed.

Specifications: Both date entries must be valid dates after the current date.  The application only accepts entries within 5 years of the current date.  On load, the arrival date is the current date and the departure date is the current date + 3 days.
